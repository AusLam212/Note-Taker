These are the routes we used to be able to access our database and delete from it as well

## How It Works

Note Taker grabs the text value written for both the title and text area and inserts it into our database known as db.json. The data from the json file is read out to the user based on what note they are viewing back on, and users can also delete old notes as well.



## Usage

Notes! Use if you need a reminder, or need a reminder for a reminder!
